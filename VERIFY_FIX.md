# ✅ Verify Mute State Persistence Fix

## 🎯 Quick Verification Steps

### Option 1: Test in Your App (Recommended)
1. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. **Open in browser**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Test the fix**:
   - ✅ Videos should start **muted** (default)
   - ✅ Click the mute button to **unmute**
   - ✅ Open DevTools → Console, you should see:
     ```
     🔇 Mute state saved: false
     ```
   - ✅ **Refresh the page** (F5 or Cmd+R)
   - ✅ Video should still be **unmuted**! 🎉
   - ✅ Check console for:
     ```
     📼 Loaded playback preferences: {isMuted: false, ...}
     ```

4. **Verify localStorage**:
   - Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Check `farcaster-feed-mute-state` = `"false"`
   - This value should persist across refreshes

### Option 2: Standalone Test Page
1. **Open the test page**:
   ```bash
   open test-mute-persistence.html
   ```

2. **Run the automated test**:
   - Click "Run Auto Test" button
   - All 4 tests should pass:
     - ✅ Write to localStorage
     - ✅ Parse boolean correctly
     - ✅ Toggle mute state
     - ✅ Persist across "refresh"

3. **Manual verification**:
   - Click "Set Muted = false"
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - Value should still be `false`

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### The Bug
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(preferences.isMuted);
// ❌ Only reads initial value (true)
// ❌ Never updates when preferences load from localStorage
```

### The Fix
```typescript
// AFTER (fixed):
const [isMuted, setIsMuted] = useState(preferences.isMuted);

// ✅ Sync with preferences when they change
useEffect(() => {
  setIsMuted(preferences.isMuted);
}, [preferences.isMuted]);
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Timeline of Events:

```
T=0ms:   🚀 Page loads
         📝 preferences.isMuted = true (default)
         📝 isMuted state = true
         🔇 Video is muted

T=10ms:  📂 usePlaybackPreferences loads from localStorage
         📝 localStorage has "false"
         📝 preferences.isMuted updates to false

T=11ms:  ✅ useEffect fires (NEW FIX!)
         📝 setIsMuted(false) called
         🔊 Video becomes unmuted

Result:  ✅ User's saved preference is restored!
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh User (No saved preferences)

## 🐛 Related Issues

### Issue
**Reporter**: User feedback  
**Message**: "when i refresh tab its muted again"  
**Date**: October 16, 2025

### Root Cause
React's `useState` hook only uses the initial value once. It doesn't automatically sync with changing props or dependencies.

### Impact
- **Severity**: HIGH (critical UX bug)
- **Affected Users**: All users
- **Workaround**: User had to unmute on every page load
